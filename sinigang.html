    <p>
      Sinigang is a Filipino soup cooked with pork. Serve with rice and for
      additional sauce, use soy or fish sauce. If you want to, you can add what
      Filipinos call gabi gabi, which is a small taro root. When peeled they
      look like potatoes. You can add five to six of them when you add the water
      and make sure they are cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked
      because they can get too soft.
